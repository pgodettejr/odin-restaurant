  "description": "The third project in the Intermediate level vanilla JS course for The Odin Project. This project involves creating a restaurant  homepage that will include elements such as images, a headline, text promoting the restaurant and more. The site will ultimately use  tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu pages with the tabbed contents being inside their own modules and be connected via  import and export logic. Everything will be generated via JS only and not HTML in the final product. This project will also test use of  npm, ES6 Modules,  Webpack and general DOM manipulation.",
